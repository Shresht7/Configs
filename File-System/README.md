> All of these live directly under the home directory (`~/`)

## `Configs`

The `Configs` repository is the home for all configuration files. This includes `.gitconfig`, The [PowerShell profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles), VS Code Settings etc.

## `Data`

The `Data` directory holds files that contain data that can be used globally across the system by many applications. This includes `.csv`, `.json`, `.yaml` etc.

## `Desktop`

Everybody likes a _clean_ desktop, and I am no exception; but it isn't just for aesthetics. Not only is it visually-appealing, a clean desktop can help reduce cognitive load. The `Desktop` is an important part of my workflow.

I treat the `Desktop` on my computer like I do a _real_ desktop - It should exclusively hold things that I am **actively** working on. An empty desktop means I have nothing going on; while excessive clutter suggests an overwhelming workload that needs streamlining. By consciously deciding what deserves a place on the desktop, you establish a sense of control and purpose in your work.

> While most applications like to drop a shortcut on your desktop, I don't feel like that is the place for your applications -- you have the Start Menu, Taskbar or an Application Launcher for that. I generally put files and shortcuts, relevant to whatever it is I'm doing, on the desktop.

The `Desktop` is the first thing you see when you open up your computer, setting the stage for focused and efficient work. A mere glance at the desktop should effortlessly transport you back to the same _mental state_ as when you last left off. Its condition should reflect the state of your **working memory**.

It is perfectly acceptable to utilize the desktop as a temporary staging area. Swiftly capturing information with minimal effort is key; organization can follow later. Most items on my desktop are transient, existing only for the duration of my current tasks. They often consist of shortcuts to the workspaces I am presently engaged in.

## `Sync`

The `Sync` folder is constantly being synchronized with my other devices (using [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net)). Most of my interactions with this folder are transient - when I need to move files from one device to another (without a headache) for example.
